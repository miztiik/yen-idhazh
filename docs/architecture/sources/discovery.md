# Source Discovery

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-20

What the Collect stage consults, how those sources are organised, and how that organisation is changed without breaking a payload an earlier run wrote. Collect is one of the two stages that see the whole day ([../../concepts/pipeline-loop.md](../../concepts/pipeline-loop.md)); this page owns the shape of what it sees.

## Three primitives, not one

The common mistake is to model every topic a reader cares about as a source list. Most topics are not source lists. Three primitives, and the distinction between them is what keeps curation affordable:

| Primitive | What it is | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vertical** | A subject that has its own reporters and its own feeds. Carries a curated feed list. | ~25 feeds to curate |
| **Lens** | A question asked of items already collected. A tag, applied after the fetch. | nothing |
| **Entity** | A named organisation followed by name, with its own primary feeds. | ~1 feed |

A lens and an entity never get their own feed list. "China" is not a desk - it appears inside four verticals. "Return on AI investment" is not a desk - no outlet publishes one. Both are questions asked of items already in hand, and asking them is free.

The payoff compounds. One supply agreement between a chip maker and a datacentre operator is three verticals, two lenses, two event types and two entities: eight index entries, one fetch, one summary.

## Verticals

Each carries a feed list, a daily cap and a lifecycle status. The current set:

| id | daily cap |
| --- | --- |
| `ai` | 5 |
| `energy` | 3 |
| `business-economy` | 3 |
| `world` | 3 |
| `india` | 3 |

The caps sum to less than the daily item ceiling on purpose, so a vertical can be added without re-opening that ruling.

**Lenses** are a closed vocabulary of cross-cutting tags. **Events** are a closed vocabulary of what happened to an item - a release, a deal, an acquisition, a funding round, a capital commitment, results, a regulatory action, research, an incident. Both are enums in the contract, not free-text strings, so a new value is a schema change with a changelog entry rather than a typo waiting to happen ([../contracts/schemas.md](../contracts/schemas.md)).

## Sources are tiered, and the tier is the weight

| Tier | What it is | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The institution that *is* the fact | a lab's own blog, a central bank, a statistical agency, a regulatory filing, a company newsroom |
| 2 | Trade press that covers the beat daily | a specialist outlet, a wire's section feed |
| 3 | Community and aggregators | a forum, a link aggregator |

Ranking is deterministic and loads no model: **tier weight, multiplied by how many independent sources carried the story, plus a bonus for a watched entity and a bonus for front-page salience.** A story three independent sources carried today is the day's story. This runs in the planning step, before any weights exist in memory.

The consequence worth stating plainly: **a link aggregator is a vote, not a source.** It contributes rank to a URL already in the pool. It never discovers, because a site with no subject taxonomy cannot be asked for a subject.

## Changing the source set without breaking history

A vertical will be retired. A feed will die quietly when a site is redesigned. Both are normal, and both are handled in config rather than in code.

- **An id is an immutable slug; the display name is a separate, freely mutable field.** Renaming what a reader sees must never orphan a payload that referenced the id.
- **Retire, never delete.** A retired vertical, lens or entity keeps its entry with a retired status and the date. Deleting an id breaks every payload written under it and forces a read-side migration; a tombstone costs one object.
- **A draft status plus a minimum-feed floor** lets a vertical be built in the open over weeks. Below the floor it is not published, so an under-sourced desk never reaches a reader.
- **Feed health is recorded, not configured.** Repeated failures quarantine a feed automatically and degrade its vertical. The run never fails because a source died.
- **Soft retirement before hard.** Drop a source's weight, watch what changes, then retire it. Reversible in one field.

## Design rationale

Segmenting by subject is a source-diversity problem, not a compute one. The pipeline had spare capacity long before it had spare sources, so the binding constraint was never how many items could be summarized - it was how many were worth summarizing, and whether they covered more than one subject.

Two findings from prior art settled the shape. First, every system that publishes a multi-subject daily digest attaches a curated feed list per subject; none of them sorts a single firehose into subjects. Second, those systems enforce a floor - roughly twenty-five feeds - below which a subject is not surfaced at all, because a thin list produces a thin day and the reader cannot tell the difference between a quiet day and a broken one.

Tiering the sources was the cheap half. Once a source carries a tier, ranking needs no model, no classifier and no judgement at run time: the arithmetic of "how authoritative" times "how widely carried" reproduces most of what an editor would pick, and it reproduces it identically on every re-run.

The lifecycle rules exist because the alternative was discovered the expensive way in other projects: a config edit that deletes an identifier silently invalidates every artifact that referenced it, and the breakage surfaces months later when someone loads an old payload.

## Rejected alternatives

| Option | Why rejected |
| --- | --- |
| A single link aggregator as the only source | No subject taxonomy; one global front page whose only tags are post types. Keyword queries against it are lexical - a query for a subject catches every casual mention of the word - and it carries no world, energy or regional coverage at all. |
| A classifier sorting one firehose into verticals | Nobody who has shipped this does it. It also puts model time into the planning step, which today loads no weights and finishes in seconds. |
| One vertical per topic of interest | Eleven verticals is roughly 275 feeds to curate and breaks the daily ceiling. Most candidate topics turned out to be lenses or entities on inspection. |
| A market-prices vertical | A once-daily, statically-committed digest is the wrong instrument for a number that moves continuously. Kept as a lens so a structural story still surfaces. |
| Splitting a subject into two verticals by angle | The same feed list serves both, so the split doubles curation to buy one taxonomy line. The separation is recovered for free by the event vocabulary. |
| Deleting a retired entry from config | Breaks every payload written under that id and forces a read-side migration. |
