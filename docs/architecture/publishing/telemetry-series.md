# Telemetry Series

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-23

The console's interactive charts read a published projection of item health. They
never read `state/item-health/` directly.

## Published shards

`backend/idhazh/publish_telemetry.py` reads
`state/item-health/<YYYY-MM>.csv` and writes
`frontend/public/telemetry/<YYYY-MM>.csv`. The browser fetches these monthly
shards on demand as the operator pans the viewport.

The published columns are exactly:

`date, run_id, item_id, vertical, source_id, stage, outcome, code, source_words, summary_words`

These source-ledger columns never cross to the browser:

- `canonical_url`
- `url_key`
- `detail`

This is a trust-boundary rule, not a size trick. `detail` is diagnostic free
text, and the URL fields are not needed to draw failure rates or compression.

## Degrade rules

A missing or unparsable month draws a gap. The page stays alive and logs a
browser-console warning. It does not invent zeroes, because zero failed items and
no data are different facts.

The default page is also prerendered as SVG from the same projection. If
JavaScript never runs, the console still shows the current window and honest
empty states.
